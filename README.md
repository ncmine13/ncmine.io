# ncmine13.io

This first project helped me to understand the interactions between basic frontend languages. Tasked with making a game, I created a trivia game that partially fills in HTML Canvas paths when the user correctly answers questions. I'd like it to serve as an educational tool, as the questions can be tailored to a particular genre or academic discipline.
