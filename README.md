Soooooooo

User Stories:
-User can click next question to get to next question
-User can answer question correctly and see circles drawn
-User can eventually identify picture after they have answered a few questions, and can enter response with "guess picture" button
-User gains points throughout game, gaining 10 points when he/she answers a trivia question correctly and 100 points when he/she identifies picture correctly


Plans I Will Go Through With:
-Lose points when incorrectly identifying image or incorrectly answering questions
-Some sort of alert when you answer question incorrectly ("Nope!")
-Some sort of alert when you incorrectly identify picture, and user will have to answer more questions
-Create more detailed canvas drawings
-Make trivia questions more legit
